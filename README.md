# todoWithNetCore

This is the tutorial at

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api

This tutorial was taken and extended to 
1. Add Xunit test framework (Still work in progress)
2. Connect to the Azure Cosmos DB to do CRUD operations on the Document DB
3. Split it as Controller - Service - Model layers

This creates a api only application to interact with TodoItems
This can be a starting project if learning to use Visual Studio 2017,  C# and Interacting with Azure. 

Visual Studion 2017 was used to publish directly and be available as a App Service in the Azure account

#TODO
 1. More meaning full test cases.
 2. Options to publish as a Azure Function (Learning)
 3. Add Call to external Apis from inside the App. To retrieve info
	for eg: add Due date to a task and get weather of that date and update back
